      <p>Circle of Excuses is a web app to help animal rights activists prepare responses to common excuses for not going vegan. Each excuse has a suggested "response" and "socratic response". The "response" is in the form of a statement, whereas the "socratic response" is in the form of a question. While there are scenarios when it makes more sense to respond with a statement, it is generally recommended to respond with a question. Using socratic responses allows people to re-evaluate their excuses and come up with conclusions on their own. This tends to be more effective than lecturing. However, whenever it makes sense to go more in-depth (ie. for teaching, citing a study, etc.), the response should be in the form of a statement. The key to an effective interaction is to find the balance between teaching and allowing the people to think things through. Another important thing to keep in mind is that people will try to deviate the conversation away from the fact that they are needlessly hurting animals. It's important to be conscious of when they are doing this and to shift the focus back to the fact that they are needlessly hurting animals. A quick way of shifting the focus back to the topic at hand is to ask them a simple question: "How does that (ie. the excuse they bring up) justify <em>you</em> needlessly hurting animals?"</p>
