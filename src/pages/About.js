      <p>Circle of Excuses is a web app to help animal rights activists prepare for common excuses for not going vegan. Each excuse has a suggested "response" and "socratic response". The "response" is in the form of a statement, whereas the "socratic response" is in the form of a question. While there are scenarios where it makes more sense to respond with a statement, it is generally recommended to respond in the form of a question. Using socratic responses allows people to re-evaluate their excuses and come up with conclusions on their own. This tends to be more effective than lecturing people. However, whenever it makes sense to go more in-depth (ie. teaching, citing a study, etc.), the response should be in the form of a statement. People appreciate being taught new things but can also get disengaged if the conversation turns into a lecture. The key to an effective interaction is to find the balance between teaching and allowing them to think things through.</p>
