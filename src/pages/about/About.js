      <p>Circle of Excuses is a web app to help animal rights activists prepare responses to common excuses for not going vegan. Each excuse has a suggested "response" and "socratic response." The "response" is in the form of a statement. Whereas, the "socratic response" is in the form of a question. While there are scenarios where it makes more sense to respond with a statement, it is generally recommended to respond with a question. Socratic responses allow people to re-evaluate their excuses and come up with conclusions on their own. This tends to be more effective than lecturing. However, in cases where a more in-depth response is necessary (such as for teaching or citing a study), a statement is the best option.</p>
      
      <p>The key to an effective interaction is to strike a balance between teaching and allowing people to come to their own conclusions. Another important thing to keep in mind is that people will try to deviate the conversation away from the fact that they are needlessly hurting animals. It's important to be conscious of when they are doing this and to shift the focus back to the fact that they are needlessly hurting animals. A quick way to get back on topic is to ask a simple question like, 'How does the excuse you brought up justify <u><em><strong>YOU</strong></em></u> needlessly hurting animals?'</p>
